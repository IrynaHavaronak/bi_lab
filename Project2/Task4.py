# A left rotation operation on an array of size n
# shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if
# 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5],
# then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].
#
# Given an array of n integers and a number, d. Perform d
# left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array
# as a single line of space-separated integers.


nd = input("Insert n and d values separeted by space: ").split(" ")
n = int(nd[1])
d = int(nd[2])
